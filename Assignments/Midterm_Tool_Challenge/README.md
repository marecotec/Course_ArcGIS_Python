# Midterm Tool Challenge

In this assignment, you are instructed to produce a small script tool that takes advantage of arcpy and Python. You will need to provide example data, and the code should run on all PC's. The tool needs to manipulate a dataset across three different processes, for example, extracting, modifying and exporting data. The exact workflow is entirely up to yourself. You are expected to take 3-4 hours on this coding assignment, and you should deposit your code and example files within a Github repository for feedback and grading.

The criteria are:
* Cleanliness of code (10 points)
* Functionality (10 points)
* Appropriate use of documentation (10 points)
* Depth of processing operation (10 points)
* In addition, you must provide example data and minimize the amount of editing a user must make in order for the program to run (10 points).

Help is here when you need it, just email Andy.
