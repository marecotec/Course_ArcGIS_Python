# Step 1 - Data Access module
#####

# You can programmatically interact with attribute tables using the data access module. It's easy, fast
# and powerful, allowing you direct access to data with only a few lines of code.

# The code is similar to how we would interact with a CSV file using the CSV package. For example:

# Using data that I obtained from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sandhill-crane-locations-autumn-2013-migration
# lets read in each record, and count how many records there are for crane number 100840:

import csv
with open(r"Step_1.csv") as crane_csv:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(crane_csv, delimiter=',')
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if row[0] == "100840":
            line_count += 1

print("There are " + str(line_count) + " csv records for crane 100840.")

# Uncomment the below, now let's now do the same using arcpy.da (arcpy data access module), you could of course
# use select and get count but we are doing it the hard way!:

# import arcpy
# line_count_da = 0
# with arcpy.da.SearchCursor("Step_1.csv", ['Crane', 'Time', 'X', 'Y']) as cursor:
#     for row in cursor:
#         if row[0] == 100840:
#             line_count_da += 1
# print("There are " + str(line_count_da) + " arcpy.da records for crane 100840.")


# Task - Using arcpy.da, count how many individual cranes there are in the Step_1.csv data (hint: 5), and
# extract their identification numbers and the number of records for each crane (hint: 100840, 100843, 100853, 100854).

# Think about what you need to do: 1: Run through each row, pull the crane, add it to a list,
# then 2: for each item in your generated list, add it to a dict, count occurrences and then 3: print your len(dict)
# and print dict.

# Here's some helper code to help you do the count, but first you must generate the list of cranes (hint: append to a
# crane list)!
# crane_count={}
# for i in YOUR_LIST_HERE:
#     if crane == row[0]:
#         if i not in crane_count.keys():
#             crane_count[i]=1  #also: if not i in d
#         else:
#             crane_count[i]+=1
